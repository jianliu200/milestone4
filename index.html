			<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
			<p>On average, most Americans read 14 books a year and it is even more if you are an avid book lover and a researcher, who has to read a lot of papers and articles. However, for people with memory difficulties it can be hard to remember certain books or details or to keep track of what books they have read. Our web app, Your Book Collection, allows users to search for a book, its author, and the gist of the book just based on what they can remember. Furthermore, there is a digital library of the books you have read and are currently reading that helps people keep track of what books they are reading and have read.</p>

			<h2>Insight from Feedback</h2>
			<p>While most of our peers liked our product, there were a few improvements and questions for us to consider: </p>
      <br>
      <p>In terms of direct improvements to the web app, we should look into getting multiple books from the search functionality and consider allowing users to make images or text larger for better accessibility. </p>
      <br>
      <p>For questions to consider, our peers challenged us that this isn’t the most pressing issue to resolve and that since the functionality is still tied to the ability to remember the book they’re not sure how well it would assist people with memory disabilities. The final question was how this web app is any different than just googling the book or asking ChatGPT about it individually.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
			<p>Overall, we think a web app with these features would be very useful. While the functionality is still tied to what a user remembers about a book, our search feature allows them to use almost anything they remember about the book to find it rather than relying on recalling specific details like title or author. In regards to the difference between our app and just using ChatGPT, the main difference would come in the form of the convenience of our search feature being in the same place as our collection of books that the person has, allowing them to quickly reference between features.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>For future iterations, as discussed in our project slides, our first priority would be adding a back-end database to save users' books. Based on our peer feedback, we would then want to add the ability to retrieve multiple books from the search feature and text and image resizing options. </p>
